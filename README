I built this application to create a template MVC 'style' app that I could then use as the start point for further development.  I used the excellent examples in the main Express github (https://github.com/visionmedia/express) repository, specifically the MVC example, as the starting point.  I have however changed it quite substantially to make it clearer and remove some of the 'magic' that confused me at first when learning.  If you are familiar with other MVC frameworks hopefully my file structure makes some sense.  

It depends on:

You need to manually install: 

* http://nodejs.org/ Node.js: Amazing javascript asynchronous IO library, install manually.
* http://www.mongodb.org MongoDB: NoSQL Database, install manually.
* http://npmjs.org/ NPM: Node package manager, used to install the remaining.

And then install via NPM:

* http://expressjs.com/ Express: Application Framework for Node.js
* http://mongoosejs.com/ Mongoose: Node.JS ORM for Mongo

But I've included in this project:

* http://embeddedjs.com/ EJS: Embedded Javascript Templating Library
* http://jquery.com/ jQuery: Javascript Library
* http://jqueryui.com/ jQuery UI: UI Library
* http://taitems.tumblr.com/post/482577430/introducing-aristo-a-jquery-ui-theme jQuery Aristo Template: Fantastic looking jQuery UI Template.

TO RUN:

* Install all the dependencies above.
* Clone project somewhere (e.g. /var/www/express-mvc-bootstrap)
* Run: node app.js
* Browse http://localhost:3000/

TODO: 

* I need to add a proper github pages site for it, with a tutorial of how to use it to setup a new application.
* EJS is currently embedded in the lib folder, this should either be a submodule or installed via npm (didn't work for me via npm)
* I'd like to write scripts that can be run to enable creation of 'template' Models, Controllers & Views (like Grails)
* Write some amazing apps?!
